# NAME

libpkgstate-plan - project native installed state into libpkgplan facts

# SYNOPSIS

**#include <libpkgstate-plan/adapter.h>**

# DESCRIPTION

**project_installed_state()** accepts one complete **pkgstate::snapshot** and one
caller-authoritative planner target context. The target context must name the
exact durable state projection represented by the snapshot.

The adapter projects package, control, release, snapshot, and ownership
identities; runtime package requirements; pre-remove and post-remove programs;
and declared target architectures. It marks all projected control groups known.

Build, check, profile expansion, installation lifecycle, installation reason,
build provenance, and rejected-object facts are not planner control and are not
counterfeited into libpkgplan.

Ownership claims carry every complete recorded object field represented by
libpkgplan. State-owned hard-link topology is not projected because the current
planner object-metadata value has no hard-link field.
